# Monte-Carlo-Integration-Optimization-Techniques

In this report, we are doing a comparitive analysis of various Monte Carlo techniques on integration and optimization problems. 

## Integration:
We take a look at Naive, Importance and Stratified Sampling methods.

### Method of Comparison:
- Convergence Plot
- Boxplots 

## Optimization:
We take a look at Basic Uniform, Non-Uniform Distribution and Simmulated Annealing methods.

### Method of Comparison:
- Plots
- Mapping the movement of the Simmulated Annealing arguement Max
- Box Plots

I would like to thank Professor Hannah Jankowski for teaching all these methods to complete this project.
